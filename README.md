# Description
This is an adaptation of [Jianwei Guos code](https://github.com/jianweiguo/push-pull) of the paper "A Simple Push-Pull Algorithm for Blue-Noise Sampling".

The main differences are:
* Added interface to MATLAB
* Adaptation of the push-pull optimization (PPO) to allow rectangular domains
* Added initialization method to start PPO on an existing point set
* A few bugfixes
